The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. Can we help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?<\br>

The goal of this assignment is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. Each row in this data-set corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a ’MachineIdentifier’. ’HasDetections’ is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for ’HasDetections’ for each machine in test.csv.
